<em>CV axle with new CV boots on a bench</em></p><h2 id=intro>Intro</h2><p>After purchasing my Daihatsu Hijet I was informed by the mechanic from the location I went to get it serviced that my CV boots were torn and should be replaced soon (my friend&rsquo;s house I was staying at <a href=https://c.tenor.com/U6L9ZrHicsgAAAAC/justin-timberlake-stare.gif target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener">literally has no tools cause the own a Tesla</a>). So after the service shop shoved a ton of grease into the CV boots as a temporary fix, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rc1zHrddzY" target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener">driving the Daihatsu Hijet all the way from Seattle to Denver</a>, and ignoring the Hijet for a few months while I worked on other vehicles I finally got around to replacing the boots.</p><p>Provided you have all the tools needed to replace the boots this task should only take a few hours complete. This guide will also make sure you don&rsquo;t take things apart out of order resulting in lots of wasted time assembling and disassembling the same components over and over again. With that said, it should be obvious I am not a professional mechanic so some terminology might be off and I am not responsible for things going wrong.</p><p>Legal disclaimers out of the way, hopefully you find this guide helpful. This guide is specifically for a 1996 Daihatsu Hijet S110P, but should mostly be the same I believe for other model years and brands (Suzuki Carry, Honda Acty, Subaru Sambar, etc).</p><p>If you see anything wrong let me know via a <a href=https://github.com/NYPD/right-hand-drive/issues target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener">GitHub issue</a> or the comments section below.

<em>Plastic cap removed from wheel exposing axle nut</em></p><p>So the first step is to loosen the axle hub nut. If going solo this should be done prior to jacking the vehicle up. Simply remove the wheel cap and use a breaker bar and a 32mm socket to break this bolt loose (remember to remove the cotter pin first). If you have a friend and jack up the car before this, your friend can simply press the brakes while you break some nuts. Also remove the axle hub washer on there too while you are at it.</p><p>Once the axle hub nut and washer is removed, take off the wheel and properly jack up the truck if you have not done so already:</p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/jacks.webp alt="CV axle with new CV boots on a bench" data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/jacks.webp data-zoomable class=medium-zoom-image>

These are 14mm in size and should not require much force. If they are proving to be pesky have someone press the brakes and use a breaker bar to knock them loose.</p><h2 id=removing-the-brake-caliper>Removing the Brake Caliper</h2><p>To remove the brake caliper, first remove the brake line (12mm) nut shown here:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/brake-line-nut.webp alt="Brake line bolt location" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/brake-line-nut.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Brake line bolt location</em></p><p>Then turn the steering wheel to allow you to easily fit a breaker bar behind the caliper and remove the bolts holding it on the knuckle (these are 17mm).</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/brake-bolts-breaker-bar.webp alt="Breaker bar with socket extension on brake caliper bolts" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/brake-bolts-breaker-bar.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Breaker bar with socket extension on brake caliper bolts</em></p><p>After you remove the brake caliper you can use the wheel you took off as an elevated platform to place the brake caliper onto so you do not stress the brake line:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/brake-caliper-removed.webp alt="Caliper removed laying on wheel" loading=lazy width=236 height=500 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/brake-caliper-removed.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Caliper removed</em></p><h2 id=loosening-the-bottom-strut-bolts>Loosening the Bottom Strut Bolts</h2><p>Next step is to break loose the bottom two strut bolts. These are 17mm and require a 17mm wrench and a 17mm socket with a breaker bar.

An axle hub removal tool would probably be easier, but unfortunately I do not own one. What ended it up working for me was using two pry bars to pry off the hub using the rotor as leverage.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/pry-bars-for-hub.webp alt="Two pry bars for removing the axle hub" loading=lazy width=236 height=500 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/pry-bars-for-hub.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Makeshift axle hub removal tool</em></p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/pry-bars-prying-hub.webp alt="Prying off the hub using two pry bars" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/pry-bars-prying-hub.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Prying off the hub using pry bars</em></p><p>With a combination of prying and hammering with a rubber mallet the axle hub should slide out:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/hub-removed.webp alt="Axle hub removed" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/hub-removed.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Axle hub removed</em></p><p>Then simply take off the dangling rotor and you are left with something that looks like this:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/hub-and-rotor-removed.webp alt="Rotor removed exposing knuckle" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/hub-and-rotor-removed.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Rotor removed exposing knuckle</em></p><h2 id=disconnecting-the-tie-rod-and-lower-control-arm>Disconnecting the Tie Rod and Lower Control Arm</h2><p>In order to disconnect these you need to first remove the castle nuts holding them on.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/tier-rod-castle-nut.webp alt="Tie rod castle nut" loading=lazy width=236 height=500 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/tier-rod-castle-nut.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Tie rod castle nut location</em></p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/lower-control-arm-nut.webp alt="Lower control arm castle nut location" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/lower-control-arm-nut.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Lower control arm castle nut location</em></p><p>Simply remove the cotter pin on them and use a 17mm wrench or socket to remove them.

The lower control arm ball joint and tier rod end bolts are usually seized up on the knuckle. To remove them we need to use a ball join separator:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-side.webp alt="Ball joint separator side" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/ball-joint-seperator-side.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Ball joint separator side</em></p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-front.webp alt="Ball joint separator front" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/ball-joint-seperator-front.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Ball joint separator front</em></p><p>You could also use a pickle fork, but these have a tendency on ripping up the rubber boot on these joints. Simply slide the ball joint separator over the ball joint making sure to center everything so you don&rsquo;t damage the bolt.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-on-tie-rod-end.webp alt="Ball joint separator placed on tier rod end" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/ball-joint-seperator-on-tie-rod-end.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Ball joint separator placed on tie rod end</em></p><p>Then using a breaker bar with a 24mm socket (your ball joint separator might have a different size) slowly tighten the ball join separator until you get jumped scared by the loud pop it makes when it releases.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-with-braker-bar.webp alt="Ball joint separator with breaker bar" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/ball-joint-seperator-with-braker-bar.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Ball joint separator with breaker bar</em></p><p>Remember the key here is to push the bolt out of the knuckle hole, so place the ball joint in the correct orientation. To prevent the tie rod from slamming down out of the knuckle, thread on the castle nut on the bolt leaving a bit of room for the tie rod end to come loose. This is done prior to placing the ball joint separator and will protect the bolt from any damage. As for the lower control arm ball joint, there is not enough room on the S110P to place the castle nut over the bolt and slide the ball joint separator on. So just line up the ball join separator the best you can. Try to place something underneath the lower control arm to &ldquo;catch it&rdquo; when it pops out of the knuckle (in my case I used the tire).</p><h2 id=removing-the-suspension-strut>Removing the Suspension Strut</h2><p>Once the jump scares are out of the way it&rsquo;s time to remove the strut suspension. Undo the 12mm nuts from the top of the strut (beneath the seats) and remove the lower strut bolts you loosened earlier.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/suspension-removed.webp alt="Suspension removed" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/suspension-removed.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Suspension removed</em></p><h2 id=removing-the-cv-axle>Removing the CV Axle</h2><p>With everything else removed all you have to do now is literally yank out the CV axle from the differential on the transmission housing. This should come out with relatively low force.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-axle-removed.webp alt="CV axle removed with knuckle still attached" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-axle-removed.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle removed with knuckle still attached</em></p><p>Removing this might leak a bit of transmission fluid. If this does happen simply drain the old transmission fluid and replace it with some <a href=https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D4URV6 target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener">75W85 GL-4 Fluid</a>. There will be a future post here showing how it is done.</p><h2 id=separating-the-knuckle-from-the-cv-axle>Separating the Knuckle from the CV Axle</h2><p>Removing the knuckle from the CV axle is a bit of a pain. After some trial and error the method I found that works best is sitting on the floor and using your feet to prop the CV axle and then hammering the CV axle <strong>through</strong> the knuckle likes so:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/hammering-axle-from-knuckle.webp alt="CV axle being hammered through knuckle" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/hammering-axle-from-knuckle.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle being hammered through knuckle</em></p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-axle-removed-from-knuckle.webp alt="CV axle separated from knuckle" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-axle-removed-from-knuckle.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle separated from knuckle</em></p><p>Use a spare rag or towel to prevent any scratches or damage to the inner CV joint. Yes this method is silly, but worked pretty well for me.</p><h2 id=replace-those-rubbers>Replace Those Rubbers</h2><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-axle-on-bench.webp alt="CV axle on bench with torn boots" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-axle-on-bench.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle on bench with torn boots</em></p><p>So now its time to replace these CV boots. Mine were in pretty bad shape. Both CV axles had torn boots and petrified rubber:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-boot-wrecked.webp alt="Torn CV boot" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-boot-wrecked.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Torn CV boot</em></p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-boot-petrified.webp alt="Petrified CV boot" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-boot-petrified.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Petrified CV boot</em></p><p>So the first step is to cut off all four CV clamps:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-boot-clamp-cut.webp alt="CV clamp cut" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-boot-clamp-cut.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV clamp cut</em></p><p>There are two of these per boot on the edges. Once these are cut, slide the inner CV joint boot down the shaft to expose the actual CV joint.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-boot-slid-away-from-inner-joint.webp alt="Inner CV boot slid down shaft exposing knuckle" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-boot-slid-away-from-inner-joint.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Inner CV boot slid down shaft exposing knuckle</em></p><p>All this grease you see will have to be cleaned up as best as possible. So take your spare rags and paper towels and start cleaning up all this old grease. Notice the little metal ring on the very end of the CV axle on the left side. Make sure this does not come off as this is important to keep the CV axle into the transmission housing (this is also an obvious indicator on which side the axle is the inner side).</p><p>Next shove in the axle into that CV joint as much you can like so:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-axle-shoved-into-joint.webp alt="CV axle shoved into joint" loading=lazy width=236 height=500 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-axle-shoved-into-joint.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle shoved into joint</em></p><p>This will expose a metal retaining ring that is keeping the joint together:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/inner-cv-joint-metal-clip.webp alt="Inner CV joint metal ring clip" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/inner-cv-joint-metal-clip.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Inner CV joint metal ring clip</em></p><p>Removing this simply requires a small flat head screw driver to pry it out. Once you remove this you should be able to pull the CV joint housing from the bearing ring. Clean up all the old grease you see on everything. Then the next step is to remove the bearing. The bearing is held on the axle by a snap ring seen here:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-inner-bearing-snap-ring.webp alt="Inner CV joint bearing snap ring" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-inner-bearing-snap-ring.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Inner CV joint bearing snap ring</em></p><p>Use some snap ring pliers and carefully remove the snap ring from the bearing without breaking or over-stretching the ring.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/snap-ring-removed-with-tools.webp alt="Inner CV joint retaining ring and snap ring removed" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/snap-ring-removed-with-tools.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Inner CV joint retaining ring and snap ring removed</em></p><p>With the bearing removed you can now slide of all the old CV boots of the axle leaving you with a naked CV axle.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-axle-naked.webp alt="CV axle with no boots" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-axle-naked.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle with no boots</em></p><p>Clean up all this old grease as best you can cause the next step is to lather this bad boy with brand new grease.</p><p>Start off with greasing the outer CV joint shoving as much you can in the bearings:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-outer-joint-greased.webp alt="CV outer joint greased" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-outer-joint-greased.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV outer joint greased</em></p><p>Then slide the the correct boot over the joint.

Afterwards apply a big ol glob of grease into the inner joint housing, slide it over the bearing, and install the retention clip. Add more grease while you are at it too:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-inner-joint-grased.webp alt="CV inner joint greased" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-inner-joint-grased.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV inner joint greased</em></p><p>Slide the inner boot over the joint and put some CV clamps on it.

I won&rsquo;t completely cover this since it is just reversed instructions, but I will mention a few key steps as well as list all the torque values.</p><h3 id=torque-values>Torque Values</h3><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Nm</th><th>lbf-ft</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Two Bottom Suspension Bolts</td><td>93</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Top Suspension Nuts</td><td>40</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Brake Caliper Bolts</td><td>112</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Hub Face Screws</td><td>47</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Axle Nut</td><td>196</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>Tie Rod Castle Nut</td><td>46</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Lower Control Arm Castle Nut</td><td>46???</td><td>34</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=pointers>Pointers</h3><p>First off, when sliding the CV axle back into the transmission housing, twist it around till you feel the grooves slide in. Then take a mallet to tap it completely into the housing.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/cv-axle-placed-in-slot.webp alt="CV axle held in place prior to using mallet" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/cv-axle-placed-in-slot.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle held in place prior to using mallet</em></p><p>Before sliding the knuckle back on make sure to grease the bearings:</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/kuckle-greased-up.webp alt="CV axle held in place prior to using mallet" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/kuckle-greased-up.webp data-zoomable></p><em>CV axle held in place prior to using mallet</em></p><p>The last thing to mention is if you have problems sliding the axle hub in, you can use the axle hub nut to slowly push it in till it&rsquo;s seated. Remember the axle hub nut is one big castle nut, so it should be very apparent how far the nut should thread on the axle.</p><p><p class=image-p><img src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/rotor-and-hub-installed-with-nut.webp alt="Rotor and hub installed using the axle nut as force" loading=lazy width=775 height=365 data-zoom-src=/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/hd/rotor-and-hub-installed-with-nut.webp data-zoomable></p><em>Rotor and hub installed using the axle nut as force</em></p><h2 id=tldr>TLDR</h2><p>Steps to take things apart in:</p><ul><li>Remove the axle hub nut</li><li>Loosen the hub bolts</li><li>Remove the brake caliper</li><li>Loosen bottom strut bolts</li><li>Remove the axle hub and rotor</li><li>Disconnect tie rod and lower control arm</li><li>Remove suspension strut</li><li>Remove the CV axle</li><li>Separate the knuckle from the CV axle</li><li>Take off inner CV joint</li><li>Replace CV boots</li><li>Re-assemble</li></ul><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>So overall nothing too complicated. Looking back on this I probably should have de-greased the CV joints to completely remove the old grease. Also from here on out I will moisturize and exfoliate the rubber CV boots to keep them nice and rubbery.</p><p>One random benefit that came from my CV boots tearing was that it flung and coated CV grease on everything which is a fantastic rust prevention method. So nothing to complain about there.</p><p>Remember, if I said anything wrong call me out in a <a href=https://github.com/NYPD/right-hand-drive/issues target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener">GitHub issue</a> or in the comments below.</p><div class=blog-tags><a href=https://righthanddrive.autos/tags/cv-boot/>CV boot</a>&nbsp;
