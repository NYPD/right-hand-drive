                "body": " Custom tachometer installed on the 96 Daihatsu Hijet Why Ever since putting on off-road worthy tires on the Hijet the road noise has increased considerably. So much so that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure at times exactly how high I was revving the truck. So to avoid blowing up the engine I decided to add a tachometer.\nThis post will quickly show how to add a tach on a 1996 Daihatsu Hijet.\nItems Used GlowShift Tachometer Wago connectors ATC Blase fuse taps Low voltage wire Tachometer Info Before we get started make sure your tachometer supports 3 cylinder engines. The Glowshift I chose allows for 1-10 cylinder support by turning a knob on the back of the unit.\nTachometer placement Find a place you want to place the tachometer at. I decided to go at the top right of the dash seen here:\nTachometer dash placement I routed all the wires behind the dash and secured them with zip ties applying some good cable management. To get better access at routing the wires I did take off the instrument dash panel. This was really simple. If you decide to go this route simply unscrew two screws at the top of the panel:\nDash panel top screws Then start popping of the trim with a small trim remover piece using the small tabs on the panel seen here:\nSmall tab to insert pry tool\nThen once you slowly pop off everything simply undo the 4x4 button wire attach to it and set the panel aside.\n4x4 button connector\nWhich Wire to Connect the Tachometer to This will be located near the distributor cap on the S110P which is near the middle of the truck. Just unscrew the engine access panel and look for this wire plug:\nTachometer wire connector location\nTo make finding this easier, this plug was connected to a female plug that had no wires attached to it. It was a just a dead-end plug. The exact wire I spliced into was this one here:\nWire to splice into\nBefore you make anything final, test out the connections first. It should be the same across all S110Ps, but I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure. After you confirm everything works use some wago connectors and hook everything up:\nWago connector\nI was afraid the wago connectors would not hold up to the engine heat, but It has been doing great so far. The green wire seen in the image above is the wire I ran all the way to the tachometer location on the dash. This wire goes through one of the grommets underneath the parking brake, under the floor mats, and up to the tachometer unit.\nGrounding and Power Last step is to connect the ground to somewhere on the chassis. Just find an exposed metal screw and attach it to that using some ring connectors. For the power I used on of the ATC Blase fuse taps to tap into the ACC fuse so the tachometer will turn on and turn off with the truck. The ACC fuse connector is the one in the bottom:\nATC tap fuse connected\nHere is a diagram of the fuse box (which you should have too):\nFuse box diagram\nThe GlowShift tachometer has a feature where it dims itself a bit if the lights are turned on. To accomplish this I connected the dimming wire to the 10A fog fuse, the TAP at the top of the first picture.\nConclusion Skipped over some details, but easy install once you know which wire to connect to. Here is a video of the final result:\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. "

                "body": " New wheels and tires next to the old ones Intro My plan for the Daihatsu Hijet is to convert it to a capable off-road worthy truck. After getting the basic maintenance out of the way, the next logical step is to install a lift kit and add bigger tires. In the off-road world it is all about ground clearance and angles. Being such a tiny truck the Daihatsu already has some pretty good approach, breakover, and departure angles. However, ground clearance is pretty mediocre with about 6\u0026quot; of ground clearance from the lowest point (the rear diff).\nThis post will quickly go over on how I installed the new wheels and tires.\nEquipment Used Tusk Terrabite® Radial Tire 25x8-12 ITP Delta Steel Wheels 4+3 4/110 bolt pattern, part number: 1221753032 2 Inch lift kit Custom made I believe from the seller \u0026ldquo;venessasmiles\u0026rdquo;. Really good quality. Gorilla lug nuts 21133BC (12mm x 1.5 thread) Hub centric rings 66.1mm to 67.1mm E-Z Tire beads 2oz for all 4 wheels Tire Decisions and Info I originally was going to go with 23x10-12 tires, but opted to go for a 25x8-12. I wanted to have as much ground clearance as possible and wanted to avoid rubbing into the suspension with wider tires. 10\u0026quot; wide tires are be able to fit a Daihatsu, but will most likely need spacers or different offset wheels to be able to fit well. Even though I wanted bigger tires, 25\u0026quot; tires is probably the max size tires one can go. MAYBE a 26\u0026quot; can work, but bigger than that will lead to a lot of clearance issues. I also did not want to go higher than a 2\u0026quot; lift kit to avoid any other complication like having to lower the transfer case or something.\nOne thing I learned from this entire process is that tire and wheel manufactures are not precise at all (or i\u0026rsquo;m just dumb and don\u0026rsquo;t understand). Wheels are not measured as one would expect. A 7 inch wheel is not exactly 7 inches and a 25 inch tire is more like a 24 inch:\nMeasuring Tusk Terrabite diameter Front Lift Kit Installing the front lift kit was very simple. Just jack up the front of the truck, remove the strut suspension, and install the \u0026ldquo;top hat\u0026rdquo; spacer from the lift kit:\nFront lift kit spacer installed on strut Front lift kit spacer fully installed You might get lucky and be able to just undo the top of the suspension and slide the spacer between the strut and frame. I was able to do this for the driver side, but not the passenger side. If you have to remove the entire strut, remember to torque down the two strut bolts at the bottom to the proper 93nm/69lbf-ft.\nOn the passenger side I also had to grind a bit of the suspension lip at the bottom seen here:\nBottom strut lip grinded down to not hit CV axle Part of the bottom suspension lip was touching and grinding against the CV axle at its extremity. You can see in the image the gouge marks it was making when I was spinning the CV axle. The suspension will not hit the CV axle with some weight on the suspension, but might as well grind this while you are here anyway.\nHub Centric Rings With the wheels removed the next step is to install the hub centric rings. This is all dependant on the wheels you get, but for the ITP Delta Steel wheels, I needed a 66.1mm to 67.1mm ring. You can most likely get away with not installing these since the S110P does not really go above 60mph, but they don\u0026rsquo;t cost much and will insure a better fitment.\nIf you are going to install hub centric rings, clean off the old hub first before you install. If you have a bit of trouble placing it on like I did, a little bit of of anti seize helped me out.\nDirty axle hub\nAxle hub cleaned out\nHub centric ring installed close up\nFront Completed Front tires installed\nRear Lift Kit Installing the rear lift kit was a little bit harder than the front, but still very easy.\nFirst remove the spare tire as this is in the way. Then jack up the rear and place jack stands on the rear frame. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have tall jack stands so I ended up using concrete blocks, maybe not the safest, but concrete can handle compression really well.\nJack stands placed on rear frame\nNext you need to remove the old shackles. This involved a little prying with a pry bar for me. Once the shackles are removed, lower the rear diff enough that you can install the new longer shackles as seen here:\nLowering rear axle to get enough roof for longer shackles\nAn easy way to know how far you need to lower the diff is to simply install the new shackles on the top mount and then slowly lower it until the holes match up with the leaf springs.\nRear lift-kit shackle installed on top mount\nAfter you bolt everything up in the rear, lift on the rear diff again so you can place the new wheels and end up with:\nNew wheels and tires mounted on\nRubbing Chances are you will have a bit of a frame rubbing issue installing a bigger tire. At first I cut just enough so it does not rub when driving down paved roads. However, when taking it off-road I was still rubbing when going over ditches and bumps on the trail. I ended up cutting and grinding just a bit more of the door and frame. This is what I ended up with:\nDaihatsu body cut to fit bigger wheels Daihatsu inner body cut to fit bigger wheels Daihatsu door cut to fit bigger wheels\nYou can see compared to the previous image posted that a good chunk was cut off, but all kept away from the actual inner cab. With this cut and upgraded springs(future post) I have not run into any rubbing issues yet.\nRemember to paint over any raw metal you exposed after cutting and grinding. I just used a clear coat of high temperature caliper paint.\nBefore and After So in the end I went from 6\u0026quot; to 7 and 3/4\u0026quot; of ground clearance from the lowest point on the S110P which was the rear differential. Was really hoping for 8\u0026quot;, but maybe with 26\u0026quot; tires that could be achieved (or a true 25\u0026quot; tire diameter).\nAlso the old tires I was had before this were trailer tires which were about 21\u0026quot; in diameter (145 R12)\nBefore new wheels After new wheels (prior to cutting body)\n"

                "body": " Torn 25+ year old tie rod boot Intro While replacing the CV boots on my Daihatsu Hijet I noticed that all the rubber boots on the tie rods and lower control arms were in rough shape. Most of them were cracked and very brittle due to being 25+ years old. Some actually had tears in the boots exposing the insides of the joints. Luckily all the joints were still in good condition so all that was needed to do is replace the rubber boots.\nTools Needed 17mm, 21mm socket and ratchet Pliers Probably a breaker bar Small flat head screw driver Ball joint seperator You could also use a pickle fork since at this point you don\u0026rsquo;t care about tearing the rubber Joint grease Grease gun And most likely a grease needle injector Really big 31/32mm socket and or pliers Getting Access to the Rubbers The first obvious step is to safely jack the front end of the Daihatsu up and remove the front wheels to have easier access to the tie rod and lower control arm joints. With the wheel removed you should now have a clear view on the problem rubbers:\nLower control arm ball joint boot and tie rod boot location Taking a closer at rubbers you can see the heavy rubber wear:\nTie rod boot wear Lower control arm ball joint boot wear\nA more detailed walk-through can be found in a previous post, but removing both the tie rod and lower control arm joint requires the removal of the 17mm castle nut along with the use of the Ball joint separator. Use some pliers to remove the castle nut cotter pin, break loose the castle nut with the breaker bar, then use the ball joint separator and get jump scared. The inner tie rod joints can simply be removed with a breaker bar, but reaching them can prove a bit tricky. A flex-head ratchet or breaker bar can be useful.\nOnce everything is separated, just use a flat head screw drive and pop off all the old rubbers:\nPopping off lower control arm ball joint boot\nSlipping on the New Rubbers First thing first, part numbers:\n4547987508 (Tie rod boot) 4334587508 (Lower control arm ball join boot) Before installing the boots, clean off all the old grease on the joints:\nTie rod joint cleaned\nAfter all the old grease is removed the next step is to simply put on the new rubber boots. Unfortunately putting the new boots on was a little tricky since they are so precise in size. For the tie rod boots I used a 31mm socket to hammer in the new boot:\nHammering in new tie rod boot with mallet\nNew tie rod boot installed\nA more cylindrical tool would have been better, but the 31mm socket worked well enough. Just be careful not to damage the boot.\nFor the lower control arm ball join boot I did not have any big enough socket to use. I instead used a pair of pliers and slowly clamped around the edges of the boot until it was seated completely.\nNew lower control arm ball joint boot\nLubing up the rubbers All that is left is using your grease gun with the grease needle and injecting the new boots with a lot of grease. Rather than pierce the rubber, I placed the needle between the boot the joint arm/bolt and squeezed grease through there.\nConclusion Put everything back together and don\u0026rsquo;t forget the torque values for both the castle nuts are 46 NM / 34 ft LBS.

                "body": " Differential fluid draining Intro While taking out the left CV axle from the Daihatsu Hijet to replace the CV boots, some differential fluid unfortunately started to slowly leak from the opening. I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice this until I went to re-install the CV axle and saw a small puddle on the ground. So rather than mix differential fluids, I opted to drain the old fluid and put in some fresh new stuff.\nThis fluid change is very straightforward and should only take about half an hour to complete.\nFluids and Tools Needed 24mm socket and ratchet 1 Quart of 80w90 gear fluid I had some 75W90 GL-4 Fluid left over that I used instead Which Bolts? To drain the front differential you just need access to two bolts located on the passenger side (front left since we in JDM land). Here are the location of the drain bolts:\nFront differential drain bolt locations The bottom bolt is the drain plug and the top bolt is the fill plug. To get easy access to these bolts you might need to remove the tire or the mud guard flap. I just opted to remove the mud flap:\nMud guard Mud guard removal\nThis gave me enough room to be able to reach the bolts with a ratchet.\nPouring That Fluid The service manual calls for 0.61 liters (0.64 quartz) of differential fluid. I however did not want to measure that specific amount so I just opted for pouring the differential fluid until it slowly started dripping out. Fill holes for these sort of things are lined up to where the suggested fill line is.\nSince it was awkward getting the differential fluid bottle in a cramped space I developed a differential fluid delivery mechanism (patent pending):\nFunnel with tube attached\nSome high tech stuff here.\nFin That is pretty much all to it. This guide is specifically for a S110P, but should be similar for other kei trucks.\n"

                "body": " CV axle with new CV boots on a bench Intro After purchasing my Daihatsu Hijet I was informed by the mechanic from the location I went to get it serviced that my CV boots were torn and should be replaced soon (my friend\u0026rsquo;s house I was staying at literally has no tools cause the own a Tesla). So after the service shop shoved a ton of grease into the CV boots as a temporary fix, driving the Daihatsu Hijet all the way from Seattle to Denver, and ignoring the Hijet for a few months while I worked on other vehicles I finally got around to replacing the boots.\nProvided you have all the tools needed to replace the boots this task should only take a few hours complete. This guide will also make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t take things apart out of order resulting in lots of wasted time assembling and disassembling the same components over and over again. With that said, it should be obvious I am not a professional mechanic so some terminology might be off and I am not responsible for things going wrong.\nLegal disclaimers out of the way, hopefully you find this guide helpful. This guide is specifically for a 1996 Daihatsu Hijet S110P, but should mostly be the same I believe for other model years and brands (Suzuki Carry, Honda Acty, Subaru Sambar, etc).\nIf you see anything wrong let me know via a GitHub issue or the comments section below. Also just click here if you want to skip to the TLDR version.\nStuff Ya Need Tools 17mm Wrench 12mm, 14mm, 17mm, 21mm, 32mm sockets and a ratchet Socket extension Breaker bar Ball joint remover kit 2 pry bars (these could be replaced with an axle hub removal tool) CV Boot Clamp Pliers There are different types of CV clamps which means different CV pliers, the ones linked are the ones I needed Rubber Mallet Hammer Floor jack, jack stands, wheel chocks. (Stay safe kids) Parts and Items Inner CV Boots and outer CV boots If store listing goes down you could try G\u0026amp;R Imports CV joint grease You could use the grease that comes with the boots, but I wanted to go ham Old rags and paper towels Potentially a friend Removing the Axle Hub Nut Plastic cap removed from wheel exposing axle nut So the first step is to loosen the axle hub nut. If going solo this should be done prior to jacking the vehicle up. Simply remove the wheel cap and use a breaker bar and a 32mm socket to break this bolt loose (remember to remove the cotter pin first). If you have a friend and jack up the car before this, your friend can simply press the brakes while you break some nuts. Also remove the axle hub washer on there too while you are at it.\nOnce the axle hub nut and washer is removed, take off the wheel and properly jack up the truck if you have not done so already:\nYou can never be too safe jacking up a vehicle Loosening the Hub Bolts Wheel and axle nut removed exposing 4 hub bolts\nWith the tire and axle nut removed the next step is to break loose the hub nuts. These are 14mm in size and should not require much force. If they are proving to be pesky have someone press the brakes and use a breaker bar to knock them loose.\nRemoving the Brake Caliper To remove the brake caliper, first remove the brake line (12mm) nut shown here:\nBrake line bolt location\nThen turn the steering wheel to allow you to easily fit a breaker bar behind the caliper and remove the bolts holding it on the knuckle (these are 17mm).\nBreaker bar with socket extension on brake caliper bolts\nAfter you remove the brake caliper you can use the wheel you took off as an elevated platform to place the brake caliper onto so you do not stress the brake line:\nCaliper removed\nLoosening the Bottom Strut Bolts Next step is to break loose the bottom two strut bolts. These are 17mm and require a 17mm wrench and a 17mm socket with a breaker bar. Just place both of those on the nut and bolt and have at it.\nBreaking the strut bolts loose\nDon\u0026rsquo;t fully unbolt these just yet as you will need the rigidity of the suspension strut to remove other components.\nRemoving the Hub and Rotor With the hub nuts loosen, its time to take them off and attempt to slide the hub off. An axle hub removal tool would probably be easier, but unfortunately I do not own one. What ended it up working for me was using two pry bars to pry off the hub using the rotor as leverage.\nMakeshift axle hub removal tool\nPrying off the hub using pry bars\nWith a combination of prying and hammering with a rubber mallet the axle hub should slide out:\nAxle hub removed\nThen simply take off the dangling rotor and you are left with something that looks like this:\nRotor removed exposing knuckle\nDisconnecting the Tie Rod and Lower Control Arm In order to disconnect these you need to first remove the castle nuts holding them on.\nTie rod castle nut location\nLower control arm castle nut location\nSimply remove the cotter pin on them and use a 17mm wrench or socket to remove them. You might need a breaker bar, but I was able to remove them with a bit of elbow grease.\nBoth castle nuts removed\nNow its time for the jump scare. The lower control arm ball joint and tier rod end bolts are usually seized up on the knuckle. To remove them we need to use a ball join separator:\nBall joint separator side\nBall joint separator front\nYou could also use a pickle fork, but these have a tendency on ripping up the rubber boot on these joints. Simply slide the ball joint separator over the ball joint making sure to center everything so you don\u0026rsquo;t damage the bolt.\nBall joint separator placed on tie rod end\nThen using a breaker bar with a 24mm socket (your ball joint separator might have a different size) slowly tighten the ball join separator until you get jumped scared by the loud pop it makes when it releases.\nBall joint separator with breaker bar\nRemember the key here is to push the bolt out of the knuckle hole, so place the ball joint in the correct orientation. To prevent the tie rod from slamming down out of the knuckle, thread on the castle nut on the bolt leaving a bit of room for the tie rod end to come loose. This is done prior to placing the ball joint separator and will protect the bolt from any damage. As for the lower control arm ball joint, there is not enough room on the S110P to place the castle nut over the bolt and slide the ball joint separator on. So just line up the ball join separator the best you can. Try to place something underneath the lower control arm to \u0026ldquo;catch it\u0026rdquo; when it pops out of the knuckle (in my case I used the tire).\nRemoving the Suspension Strut Once the jump scares are out of the way it\u0026rsquo;s time to remove the strut suspension. Undo the 12mm nuts from the top of the strut (beneath the seats) and remove the lower strut bolts you loosened earlier.\nSuspension removed\nRemoving the CV Axle With everything else removed all you have to do now is literally yank out the CV axle from the differential on the transmission housing. This should come out with relatively low force.\nCV axle removed with knuckle still attached\nRemoving this might leak a bit of differential fluid. If this does happen simply drain the old differential fluid and replace it with some 80W90 gear oil. There will be a future post here showing how it is done.\nSeparating the Knuckle from the CV Axle Removing the knuckle from the CV axle is a bit of a pain. After some trial and error the method I found that works best is sitting on the floor and using your feet to prop the CV axle and then hammering the CV axle through the knuckle likes so:\nCV axle being hammered through knuckle\nCV axle separated from knuckle\nUse a spare rag or towel to prevent any scratches or damage to the inner CV joint. Yes this method is silly, but worked pretty well for me.\nReplace Those Rubbers CV axle on bench with torn boots\nSo now its time to replace these CV boots. Mine were in pretty bad shape. Both CV axles had torn boots and petrified rubber:\nTorn CV boot\nPetrified CV boot\nSo the first step is to cut off all four CV clamps:\nCV clamp cut\nThere are two of these per boot on the edges. Once these are cut, slide the inner CV joint boot down the shaft to expose the actual CV joint.\nInner CV boot slid down shaft exposing knuckle\nAll this grease you see will have to be cleaned up as best as possible. So take your spare rags and paper towels and start cleaning up all this old grease. Notice the little metal ring on the very end of the CV axle on the left side. Make sure this does not come off as this is important to keep the CV axle into the transmission housing (this is also an obvious indicator on which side the axle is the inner side).\nNext shove in the axle into that CV joint as much you can like so:\nCV axle shoved into joint\nThis will expose a metal retaining ring that is keeping the joint together:\nInner CV joint metal ring clip\nRemoving this simply requires a small flat head screw driver to pry it out. Once you remove this you should be able to pull the CV joint housing from the bearing ring. Clean up all the old grease you see on everything. Then the next step is to remove the bearing. The bearing is held on the axle by a snap ring seen here:\nInner CV joint bearing snap ring\nUse some snap ring pliers and carefully remove the snap ring from the bearing without breaking or over-stretching the ring.\nInner CV joint retaining ring and snap ring removed\nWith the bearing removed you can now slide of all the old CV boots of the axle leaving you with a naked CV axle.\nCV axle with no boots\nClean up all this old grease as best you can cause the next step is to lather this bad boy with brand new grease.\nStart off with greasing the outer CV joint shoving as much you can in the bearings:\nCV outer joint greased\nThen slide the the correct boot over the joint. For my kit the large boot was what I had to use for the outer joint.\nNew CV boot on outer joint\nWhen sliding the boot make sure to line up the smaller diameter of the boot over the axle groove seen here:\nCV axle boot groove\nAfter the outer joint boot is done, put some CV clamps on it (don\u0026rsquo;t tighten yet) and then slide the inner CV boot in.\nNew Inner CV boot slid in\nNow you can put on the bearing in the correct orientation, apply the snap ring back, and grease it. Afterwards apply a big ol glob of grease into the inner joint housing, slide it over the bearing, and install the retention clip. Add more grease while you are at it too:\nCV inner joint greased\nSlide the inner boot over the joint and put some CV clamps on it. With all the clamps placed, use your CV pliers to tighten the CV clamps.\nCV pliers on clamp\nNext use a hammer to gently hammer in the clamp nubs that are sticking out. The end product will look something like so:\nCV axle boots completed\nPutting Everything Back Together Remember all the stuff you did to remove everything to get access to the CV axle? Well now you have to do it in reverse. I won\u0026rsquo;t completely cover this since it is just reversed instructions, but I will mention a few key steps as well as list all the torque values.\nTorque Values Nm lbf-ft Two Bottom Suspension Bolts 93 69 Top Suspension Nuts 40 30 Brake Caliper Bolts 112 83 Hub Face Screws 47 34 Axle Nut 196 145 Tie Rod Castle Nut 46 34 Lower Control Arm Castle Nut 46??? 34 Pointers First off, when sliding the CV axle back into the transmission housing, twist it around till you feel the grooves slide in. Then take a mallet to tap it completely into the housing.\nCV axle held in place prior to using mallet\nBefore sliding the knuckle back on make sure to grease the bearings:\nCV axle held in place prior to using mallet\nThe last thing to mention is if you have problems sliding the axle hub in, you can use the axle hub nut to slowly push it in till it\u0026rsquo;s seated. Remember the axle hub nut is one big castle nut, so it should be very apparent how far the nut should thread on the axle.\nRotor and hub installed using the axle nut as force\nTLDR Steps to take things apart in:\nRemove the axle hub nut Loosen the hub bolts Remove the brake caliper Loosen bottom strut bolts Remove the axle hub and rotor Disconnect tie rod and lower control arm Remove suspension strut Remove the CV axle Separate the knuckle from the CV axle Take off inner CV joint Replace CV boots Re-assemble Summary So overall nothing too complicated. Looking back on this I probably should have de-greased the CV joints to completely remove the old grease. Also from here on out I will moisturize and exfoliate the rubber CV boots to keep them nice and rubbery.\nOne random benefit that came from my CV boots tearing was that it flung and coated CV grease on everything which is a fantastic rust prevention method.

                "body": " ST205 tachometer removed from instrument panel The Problem Upon buying my Toyota ST205 I noticed that the tachometer was not working properly. It would never go above 3k RPMs despite hard acceleration and the car would idle at 200 RPM which didn\u0026rsquo;t quite seem right. Here is a short video of how the tachometer behaved on idle:\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. After some research online I discovered a thread that suggested replacing the capacitors on the tachometer as a potential fix. Luckily doing this fixed my issue and this post will briefly guide you on how to get access to the tachometer and replace the capacitors yourself.\nInstrument Panel Trim Removal The first step is to remove this trim piece:\nInstrument Cluster Lower Trim\nThere are no screws holding it in place, so take your trim tool and slowly start popping off the tabs. Here are the locations of the metal tabs to place the most leverage on:\nInstrument Cluster Lower Trim Tab locations\nOnce this is off the next step is to remove the plastic trim surrounding the instrument panel. There are 4 screws holding this in place:\nInstrument Panel Surrounding Trim Screw Locations\nAfter this is off all that is left is to just wiggle the instrument panel loose and disconnect the three connectors from the back of it. Take your time to make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t break anything.\nTachometer Removal I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any pictures for this, but to get access to the tachometer you will need to slowly disassemble the instrument panel by unscrewing the screws holding the plastic faceplate. Then you will need to remove the surrounding plastic trim shroud by pressing on the several tabs that are holding it in place. (This will be a good time to clean the clear plastic faceplate to remove any dust or marks.) After removing the face plate and shroud, you should be able to see 3 screws holding each of the gauges in place on the back. Unscrew the three screws from the tachometer gauge and gently remove the tachometer from the instrument panel.\nThese instructions are from memory so I may have missed a step or two. There should not be anything complicated on this removal. Just take your time and use your noggin to see how everything is held together. If requested I would not mind disassembling the instrument panel again to take pictures of the process.\nCapacitor Replacement Now with the tachometer removed we can now replace the two capacitors on the circuit board:\nTachometer with Capacitors Circled\nAs you can see there is plenty of room on the side to desolder the old capacitors and resolder new ones. There is no need to remove the actual dial face and needle. The capacitors I went with is the Panasonic EEA-FC1E100 bought on the mouser electronics website. Even though you only need two, it might be a good idea to buy a few spares in case you break one while soldering or want to have back up capacitors for the future. Also make sure you install the capacitor in the correct polarity orientation.\nAfter the new capacitors are installed carefully put everything back together. With a bit of luck that this was the cause of your tachometer issues, you should hopefully see a functional gauge:\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Summary Hopefully this will resolve the issue with your tachometer problem. At first I didn\u0026rsquo;t think this will work since both capacitors on my tachometer didn\u0026rsquo;t seem corroded or blown. The tachometer dial was also moving up and down prior to this fix which made me believe that it might be something else.\nPerhaps one of my capacitors was bad which caused the tachometer to half function? No clue.\n"

                "body": " Old oem Celica rear speaker next to a new Polk audio DB5252 speaker Intro So you bought yourself an ST205 and want to upgrade the sound system to the 21st century? Well you are in luck as the process is very straightforward and hopefully with this article you will be able be ready for the roadblocks that i\u0026rsquo;ve run into. Although straightforward, expect this to take a bit of time to fully complete. If you have all the parts and tools beforehand, a solid weekend of tinkering should be all you need.\nThis article is not a complete guide and will assume you are capable of removing panels, soldering connections, crafting mounts, etc. This is also my first article on the site so formatting and flow will probably be wonky.\nEquipment Used This is the equipment I used for on this project, feel free to swap whatever with your preferred brands.\nAudio/Nav System Sony XAV-AX7000 Polk Audio DB 6502 Polk Audio DB 5252 Kicker 46HS10 NATIKA Backup Camera 2 Ports Dual USB 3.0 T-SPEC - Battery Terminal Parking bypass for Head Unit Kicker 46KISL Car Audio Amp Amplifier Speaker Wire AudioQuest adapter Gardner Bender HSB-28 WAGO 221 LEVER-NUTS TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin Cable THIKPO G420 Jumper Cables Nilight Quick Disconnect Terminals Kuject butt connectors Crutchfield CK12 Tools / Hardware Dremel 4000-6/50 Basic tools (screwdriver set, socket set, etc) Trim removal tools Birch plywood squares or similar size Acrylic sheet ZELCAN Large Step Drill Bit Jet Line / Pull Line Nut and bolt assortment M10 Washers Interior Removal So the first step to start this process is the removal of all the interior trim and rear seats to get access to the OEM speakers. Compared to other JDM cars I have worked with (just a Subaru GC8) this Celica has been simpler in my opinion.\nThe door cards/panels were straightforward. They both had two/tree plastic plugs that had screws underneath, so just pop the plugs with your plastic trim tools and undo the screws. There was also a hidden screw under the inner door handle plastic cup as seen here:\nPassenger door handle trim cup removed\nThen once you remove all these screws and plastic retainers, with a little bit of wiggling you can pop out the door panels/cards and disconnect the power window switch and illumination light cable from them.\nPassenger door panel removed\nAfter this you can start the removal of the rear seats and the rear side trim (the trim that contains the rear speakers). The rear speaker grilles can be popped off with a trim tool to reveal additional screws to remove. The only small tricky part I recall is the bottom portion of the rear seat. Once you unbolt everything from the seat, you have to yank the front part of the cushion to remove it from the car frame. It is connected by two metal hooks that lock into the \u0026ldquo;lock hook\u0026rdquo; mechanism. The red circle on the image shows where these hooks go into and where you have to pull from to remove the rear seat cushion.\nRear seat and trim removed. Red circle shows the hook lock (there is another one on the other side)\nOnce you are done removing all the necessary trim you can now unplug and unscrew both the front and rear speakers. Since your Celica is probably over 25 years old they will prob look a little bit like this:\nOld front speakers\nOld rear speakers\nThe front speaker diaphragms were a bit petrified and the foam was starting to fall apart. The rears faired a bit better, but still in a poor state. I\u0026rsquo;m not too knowledgeable when it comes to speaker technology, but to me this is one of the downsides to using paper as a woofer material. Humid conditions, like the ones found in Japan, lead to a deterioration in the speakers over time. Now granted this is over 25+ years, but i\u0026rsquo;m sure if polypropylene cones were used back then (if the technology existed in the 90\u0026rsquo;s not sure) the old oem speakers would have held off much better. Paper technology and chemical coatings have probably come a long way since then, but i\u0026rsquo;m still hesitant to use or recommend paper speaker woofers because of this. These were not so bad compared to the ones found on my 1994 WRX STi:\nReally old and petrified 1994 WRX STi speaker\nRegardless, with this mini rant out of the way lets move on to the next section.\nInstalling the new speakers Take the new speakers you ordered, remove them from their packaging, and then come to the realization that they do not fit properly and the included speaker adapters won\u0026rsquo;t work either. Unfortunately I ran into this issue when my small brain blindly trusted Crutchfield that a 6.5\u0026quot; speaker will work in the front and a 5.25\u0026quot; speaker will work in the back.\nNow on the Mr. Brightside I wanted to use the Polk Audio DB speakers regardless as they are well reviewed. I have also used them before on my 94 STi and liked the sound quality they produce. Here are the new speakers in comparison to the Celica speaker brackets:\nPolk Audio DB6502 inside front Celica speaker bracket\nPolk Audio DB5252 inside rear Celica speaker bracket\nAs you can see the mounting screws do not line up properly on either bracket. The front speaker brackets have a screw spacing of 8\u0026quot; and the rear speaker bracket has a screw spacing of 6.25\u0026quot;. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall exactly, but I kinda remember trying the 6.25\u0026quot; DB6502 speaker in the rear and it STILL did not line up properly. Looking online I found some threads stating certain 8\u0026quot; speakers worked like the Focal ISU 200 on the front bracket without any modifications, but chances are the speakers you prefer or want to buy will require some modification and crafting.\nHopefully you are better equipped than me, but all the following custom speaker adapters were done with just a Dremel 4000-6/50. The adapters a little sloppy around the edges, but It did not turn out too bad.\nRear speakers I first started by removing the old speakers from the bracket (you will need to desolder the wire connections as they hardwired/soldered on). Then I flipped the speaker over a birch plywood I bought from Home Depot and drew a rough outline of the adapter frame the old speaker had. In the middle of the outline I then drew a circle slightly smaller than the DB5252 speaker to allow the speaker edge to rest on the plywood and not fall through.\nBirch plywood with rear speaker adapter outlined\nThis is the birch plywood squares I bought from Home Depot:\nBirch plywood square bought at Home Depot\nWith the aftermath of a lot sawdust everywhere, I drilled out the outlines with the Dremel:\nRear speaker adapter cutout\nAnd was able to secure the speaker with cheap nuts and bolts I have bought from Harbor Freight:\nRear speaker adapter complete\nI would suggest to add a bit of blue loctite 242 (or equivalent) on the speaker bolts to prevent the nuts from shaking loose. Also add a bit of foam tape on the edges as seen on the picture above to prevent any rattling against the speaker grille. As far as the wiring in concerned, extend the existing cables you desoldered with 16 gauge speaker wire using the Kuject butt connectors to connect them. Then add spade connectors from the Nilight Quick Disconnect Terminals kit. The results will look something like so:\nRear speaker wire extended with spade connectors attached\nRear speaker wire extension connected\nIn the end I went through a few birch plywoods before I finally cut one that was half way decent. If you do not have better equipment or have the same mediocre woodwork skills as me, making these brackets will take a bit of time. If possible might I suggest trying to create these brackets out of an acrylic sheet rather than birch wood for increased durability and humidity resistance.\nFront Speakers The front speaker adapters are much easier to cut out than the rears. The rears had this rounded square shape going on which made routing the outlines free handed with only a Dremel way too annoying. The front adapters are just a 8\u0026quot; diameter circle with another circle in the middle to let the front speakers rest on it. So unless you are buying an 8\u0026quot; speaker that will avoid all this your first step will be to remove the sticky sealant from the speaker and the frame.\nCutting through the weatherstrip adhesive on the front speaker and bracket using a small pick\nAfter you pry the speaker off and desolder the wires, flip that speaker over on top your wood panel and trace the speaker outline as well as the screw holes.\nFront speaker flipped over on birch plywood\nFront adapter fully cut\nOnce everything is fully cut mount the adapter back to the front speaker bracket using some 3M Weatherstrip adhesive to replace some of the adhesive you peeled off. Then install the new speaker and add some foam tape to the edges of the adapter to prevent any rattling sounds on the door panel. Remember to add blue loctite 242 on the speaker nut and bolts.\nFront speaker adapter complete with speaker installed\nNow all you have to do is add some spade connectors to the wires you desoldered and attach them to the speaker terminals.\nCenter Console Trim Removal Before moving on to the head unit, you will need to remove all the center console trim pieces to get access to the old cassette deck unit (or whatever came your Celica). Start off by removing the shift knob and then popping off the shift boot/cigarette lighter trim with your trim pry tools (don\u0026rsquo;t forget to unplug the cigarette lighter wire before yanking it off).\nShift boot trim removed\nWith this removed it will expose two screws which I have circled in red on the next image. Remove these screws and once again pop off the head unit trim with your trim tool.\nPrying off the head unit trim with a trim tools\nCarefully disconnect the top two connectors from this trim and set it aside. All you have left is to remove the actual head unit cage and disconnect the wiring harness from the cassette deck.\nCenter console trim and head unit completely removed\nThe two blue connectors you see in the image is the Celica\u0026rsquo;s wiring harness. These will be diagramed and explained in the next section.\nHead Unit Connections Luckily the JDM version of the Celica did not cause any additional difficulty when connecting the head unit wire connector to the receiver wiring harness. It did, however, make me spend a lot of time cross referencing multiple sites including the Crutchfield \u0026ldquo;WireGuide™\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything lined up correctly. The following is an aggregation of all the information I have rounded up.\nSo first of all the head unit I went with is the Sony XAV-AX7000. The big reason I went with this unit is that this specific model comes with a built-in amplifier. This means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to mess around with trying to find a spot to mount an external amplifier which would take up the little amount of cargo room the Celica has. The built in amp has a 45 watt RMS and a 100 watts peak which lines up well with the Polk Audio speakers. The Polk Audio speakers also have a very high db sensitivity (91/92 db) which will allow the Sony XAV-AX7000 to easily drive them.\nThe receiver wiring harness I got (which came for free with my Crutchfield order) is the Metra 70-1761 Receiver Wiring Harness. This is what the head unit will connect to and then in turn connect to the Celica\u0026rsquo;s wire harness.\nHere is the Celica\u0026rsquo;s wire harness connectors with a diagram of the wire factory colors that are attached to said connectors.\nCelica Wire Harness connectors\nMain bigger wire harness connector (R3) diagram [FL: Front Left, FR: Front Right]\nMain smaller wire harness connector (R2) diagram [RL: Rear Left, RR: Rear Right]\nNote that these colors DO NOT MATCH the Metra 70-1761 Receiver Wiring Harness nor the Sony XAV-AX7000 unit wires. I\u0026rsquo;m assuming the wire color scheme used in the ST205 was an old obsolete scheme or maybe just a random scheme, not entirely sure.\nNow here are the actual connections you will need to make. I\u0026rsquo;ve also added connections for the Kicker powered sub, the backup camera, and the parking override bypass.\nSony XAV-AX7000 16-Pin Black Connector Metra 70-1761 Wiring Harness 10-Pin Connector ST205 MicroBypass Kicker 46HS10 Nakita Reverse Cam ACC Red Red Red Front Left Speaker + White White Front Left Speaker - White/Black White/Black Front Right Speaker + Gray Gray Front Right Speaker - Gray/Black Gray/Black Illumination Orange/White Orange/White Remote / Antenna / Amp Turn On Blue/White Blue Blue Blue Constant Power Yellow Battery Positive Terminal Red Parking Light Green Green Ground Black Bare metal Black Ground Black Black Black Sony XAV-AX7000 16-Pin Black Connector Metra 70-1761 Wiring Harness 6-Pin Connector Rear Left Speaker + Green Green Rear Left Speaker - Green/Black Green/Black Rear Right Speaker + Purple Purple Rear Right Speaker - Purple/Black Purple/Black To clear a little confusion on the first table, both the Sony XAV-AX7000 and the Kicker 46HS10 were grounded to the chassis. Using a ring terminal the Sony head unit was grounded to a nut/bolt behind the center console and the Kicker sub to the a nut/bolt on the driveshaft tunnel. Also the constant power from both the head-unit and powered sub were routed through the firewall and to the positive battery terminal, more on this in a later section.\nFor the the connections from the Sony XAV-AX7000 to the Metra wiring harness that were 1:1 the Kuject butt connectors were used. All other connections I used WAGO 221 LEVER-NUTS. The personal reason for this was to have the flexibility to add or remove cables from these \u0026ldquo;non-permanent\u0026rdquo; connections without worrying about having to cut and resolder the wires. This will be convenient in the event if a new electrical device gets added or removed.\nAll the remaining wires that were not used were taped off such as the Metra\u0026rsquo;s yellow constant or the Sony XAV-AX7000\u0026rsquo;s brown and green input wires.\nSubwoofer So the subwoofer I went with is the Kicker 46HS10 which is a compact self powered 10\u0026quot; sub. For the same reason I got the Sony XAV-AX7000, I went with a self powered sub to save as much space as possible. I could not afford to use up any trunk space to put in a boxed sub.\nThe best place I found to install this sub was under the passenger seat. With the addition of a few washers for the rear left seat bolt, the seat is able to slide back and forth without hitting the Kicker 46HS10.\nKicker 46HS10 on floor behind passenger seat\nKicker 46HS10 beneath passenger seat\nKicker 46HS10 hidden under passenger seat positioned all the way back\nHowever the grille on the Kicker 46HS10 does come in contact with the seat if there is someone sitting on it. The washers did help a bit, but to my knowledge there are only 3 options one can do to alleviate this or fix it completely.\nBuy the smaller 8\u0026quot; Kicker Hideaway HS8 It is 3-1/4\u0026quot; height vs 3-3/8\u0026quot; Hammer in the grille on the Kicker 46HS10 The grille sticks out unnecessarily compared to the frame and can be hammered flat without sacrificing sound Lift the actual passenger seat This is a lot of work. I used some washers on the rear left bolt which aided a bit in raising the seat, but the rear right bolt on the passenger seat is bolted on the side of the driveshaft tunnel. So adding washers there would not accomplish anything. Some custom fabrication will be required. The option that I went with is option #4, none of the above. Having someone in the seat did not affect the bass in any way nor create any unwanted rattle. However, if this grows to be a concern in the future I will probably go with option #2 as it\u0026rsquo;s the easiest.\nTo conceal the wire connections, cutting a hole in the carpet near the bottom of the driveshaft tunnel proved to be quite good:\nKicker 46HS10 connection cable running through carpet near driveshaft tunnel\nMake sure to cut this hole near the area where the connector on the Kicker 46HS10 will be to avoid any cable bending. The cables can then be ran up the driveshaft tunnel and up to the head unit location without any pinching.\nKicker 46HS10 connection cable coming out of the driveshaft tunnel\nConnecting the Kicker 46HS10 to the Sony XAV-AX7000 was really easy with the purchase of the Kicker 46KISL 2ch. Speaker-RCA Converter and the AudioQuest RCA adapter. Just use some butt connectors to connect the subwoofer harnesses audio wires to the Kicker 46KISL RCA converter. Next attach the AudioQuest RCA adapter and connect it to the sub-out port on the Sony XAV-AX7000. Since the subwoofer harness and the RCA adapter are both from Kicker the wire color scheme connections are really easy:\nKicker 46HS10 Kicker 46KISL Left Channel Positive White White Left Channel Negative White/Black White/Black Right Channel Positive Grey Grey Right Channel Negative Grey/Black Grey/Black Mounting the subwoofer is also really easy. The Kicker 46HS10 does come with a few mounting brackets inside, but there was no real way to attach it to anything under the passenger seat. What I ended up doing is attaching two really long strips of double sided velcro to the back of the unit, but just using the side with the hooks so it can sink in and grab unto the carpet.\nKicker 46HS10 with double sided adhesive velcro strap attached to the back of it\nOnce the velcro strips grab unto the carpet it is not going anywhere. Keep in mind that removing this is a real pain in the butt unless you remove the passenger seat (learn from my dumb mistake). Save this step for the very end once everything else is done.\nConstant Battery Terminal Power Both the Kicker 46HS10 and the Sony XAV-AX7000 are required/recommended to be connected directly to the car\u0026rsquo;s positive battery terminal. This means you will have to run cables through the car\u0026rsquo;s firewall. Luckily the ST205 has a convenient grommet you can go through on the passenger side. Located on the rear right side of the engine bay (looking at it) remove the two nuts holding the grommet. If you run into the issue like I did where the grommet was seized on, just use some elbow grease and maybe a bit of penetrating fluid to yank off.\nFirewall grommet unsecured with two red power cables running through\nWires running below Firewall grommet wrapped in plastic shielding\nIn the image above you can see I decided to run the power cables to the head unit and subwoofer underneath the grommet itself. You could slit a hole through the rubber grommet and run it directly through, but It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of work to make it look sleek and OEM (in my opinion). I did however make sure that placing the grommet back on top of the cables won\u0026rsquo;t pinch them. As for the cables themselves, the Kicker 46HS10 already came with wiring to connect to the battery and for the Sony XAV-AX7000 I went with the Crutchfield CK12 wiring kit. After you run the cables through the grommet opening and cut it to the proper length, just connect it to the positive battery terminal and neatly apply some cable management to the cables to avoid any interference. You could also decide, like I did, to extend the Crutchfield CK12 lead to be able to hide the fuse on the right side the battery.\nHead-unit and subwoofer power wiring connected to positive battery terminal\nWhile this is properly and safely connected, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the look of these cables connecting to the battery terminal this way. I also have plans on adding fog lights which means I will have yet another cable to connect to the terminal. This is where the T-SPEC - Battery Terminal comes in. This terminal allows for 4 cable connections to be neatly attached to the battery terminal. To get this installed just cut the existing terminal connector off of the starter and harness wire (I think this is what these are). Make sure to cut as little as possible as it will be a real pain to run new wires if cut too short.\nExisting starter and harness power cable cut\nOnce cut we now need to extend them to be able to reach the battery terminal once again. I cut off my desired length of cable from the THIKPO G420 Jumper Cables I purchased and attached it to the starter cable (the thicker one) using the Gardner Bender HSB-28 to make the connection.\nStarter cable extended and connected to the T-SPEC connector with the harness cable extended as well\nI then cut off the ring terminals from the subwoofer power cable and the Crutchfield CK12 wiring kit and attached them to the T-SPEC connector.\nAll power wires connected to the T-SPEC terminal\nAs you can see I left a spot open for my future fog lights and connected both the subwoofer and head unit power cables to the same connector on the T-SPEC terminal. One thing to note about this T-SPEC terminal is that it did not properly fit on the battery terminal node. I had to actually pry it open a bit and find a longer bolt to be able to secure it in properly. This might vary from battery to battery, but it is something to keep in mind.\nReverse Camera The rear view camera I opted for was the NATIKA Backup/Front View Camera. It is well reviewed and has decent picture quality for a pretty cheap camera. Unless you have a very specific reason, there is no need to get an expensive camera or anything with crazy high resolution since the main purpose of a back-up camera is to tell you if you are going to hit something or not. The place I settled to install the camera is the rear center panel. To get this panel off you will need to first remove all trunk trim panels. These are very straightforward and if you already removed the rear seats in the previous steps you will have easy access to the screws and plastic trim clips. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to fully remove the panels, just enough to have space to work in. Once you are done with the panels the next step is to remove the rear tail lights. The rear tail lights are held in by three nuts as show below:\nRight rear taillight removed with nut locations circled\nMy 1996 ST205 did not have any weather adhesive holding the rear taillights unlike my 1994 STi (might be the same with all other ST205s). So with a little wiggling they were able to come off easily. Once the taillights are removed you will then see these two nuts (mine were pretty rusty) on either side of the rear center panel:\nRear center panel bolt shown (9016360010)\nRemove those two bolts and now the only thing holding the center panel in place are 8 plastic retainers as seen here:\nRear center panel removed with plastic retainers circled\nThe best way I found to remove these was spray a little bit of penetrating fluid on the retainers themselves and using a rubber mallet to carefully hammer the retainers out from the trunk. Once you popped out all the retainers, unplug the rear license plate light cable and you are done.\nRear center panel removed completely\nNext step is to drill a hole in the panel for the backup camera (The NATIKA instructions recommended a 5/16\u0026quot; drill bit I believe). The drilling location I settled for was the top of the panel above the license plate mounts:\nRear center panel with hole drilled on top\nRear center panel with hole drilled on top inside view\nTo drill this hole I had to remove the bracket that held in the license plate lights. I then placed the rear camera on to make sure everything aligned well and was flush.\nRear center panel with camera placed\nOnce everything looks good, the last thing you will need to do is cut a hole on the license plate light bracket to allow the nut for the camera to spin freely and secure the camera on. Here is a picture with a red arrow showing what I did on the light bracket:\nHole cut on license plate light bracket to allow for nut spinning\nAfter you secure the rear camera on you then need to run the camera wire into the trunk. I decided to use the existing grommet for the license plate lights cable. A more professional option would have been to drill a new hole for it, but this was works well enough. Now all that is left is to install everything in reverse order and with a bit of cleaning the final result will look pretty good:\nRear center panel installed with NATIKA back-up camera\nNow run the camera wires all the way back to the center console to plug into the head unit. I decided to run the wires on the passenger side and through a channel in the passenger door sill:\nPassenger door sill plate wire channel\nWith all the interior trim removed from the speaker installation this should be very easy. Just take your time and do some proper cable management. Also keep in mind that the NATIKA back-up camera comes with built in guide lines with the option to remove them by cutting certain wires on the camera (read the instructions). I would recommend to not cut them yet and wait till everything is attached to the head unit for you to decide if you prefer the built in guide lines or use the ones on the Sony XAV-AX7000. I opted for the built in NAKITA guide lines and turned off the Sony guide lines in the head unit settings.\nReverse Camera Indicator So the Sony XAV-AX7000 has a feature (along with probably all other modern head units) that switches to the reverse camera automatically when the car is put into the reverse gear. This is the purple/white wire on the Sony XAV-AX7000. Unfortunately the ST205 (at least for the 1996 model) does not feature a reverse indicator on the main wire harness. This means you will have to do some hunting on where to connect the purple/white wire to. There are two options you can do when it comes to the ST205.\nConnect to the back-up light switch (Either the IL1 or IG1 connector) Connect directly to the reverse tail light switch Here is the diagram of the back-up switch:\nST205 Back-up switch diagram (Pin 9 for IL1 and pin 10 for IG1)\nThe IL1 connector is located in the engine near the engine control module:\nIL1 Connector Location\nThe IG1 is located in the kick panel:\nIG1 Connector Location\nI initially opted for the first option, but unfortunately I could not find the IG1 connection at all. The diagrams I provided were all I had to go off of and the diagram itself is reversed (it shows a left hand drive car). I think the IG1 is actually on the driver side somewhere, but i\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure. I could have traced the rear tail-light wire to the BQ1 connector (which is located on the right rear side near the suspension pillar) all the way to the IG1 connector, but even if I did find it there would have been hardly any room to work in. This would have been very annoying trying to splice a wire down there so instead I went with option #2.\nOption #2 is the easiest and what I would recommend. If you already took off the trim and lights trying to install the reverse camera, this will be incredibly easy.\nFirst find the connector for the rear tail light. I choose to the rear-left light as I was already running the reverse camera through the passenger side. Once you found the connector, unplug it and find the red/white wire on it. This is the power to the back-up bulb (might not hurt to double check this with a buddy and a multi meter).\nAfter you find the correct wire, cut it and attach a 3 conductor WAGO 221 lever nut to it. Two ports to restore the original connection and the third port to run a wire from to the head unit.\nRear left taillight splice with a WAGO 221 connector\nThe wire I used to attach to the Wago 221 lever nut and run to the head unit was a 18 gauge TYUMEN 40FT 2 Pin wire. I simply cut it to length and removed the black wire to make it a single wire going back to the center console.\nIf everything is connected properly, the head unit will now automatically switch to rear camera once the reverse gear is engaged:\nSony XAV-AX7000 reverse camera display\nOptional Tweeters I am not fully certain, but it seems tweeters were a dealer upgrade back in the 90\u0026rsquo;s for the ST205. If you look around the web, the side mirror trim pieces either have a tweeter frame built in to it or are just flat. The ones in my ST205 were flat (part number 6749120320 and 6749220320) did not come with factory tweeters. However, there seems to be a connector for them on the door frame right next to the main door speaker. Just some random information.\nThe Polk Audio DB 6502 speakers came with two tweeters and a passive crossover to hook everything into. The Polk Audio DB 5252 also came with the same tweeter and crossover setup, but two is all you really need. Since I wanted crispy highs on my audio I opted to custom install the tweeters in the front side mirror trim pieces.\nThe first thing I needed was the ZELCAN Large Step Drill Bit. This had the perfect hole size to allow the tweeter housing to pass through. Just center the housing, punch a pilot hole through, and then drill to the appropriate size.\nPunching a pilot hole through the side mirror trim using a heated pick\nHole drilled on side mirror trim for tweeter housing\nTweeter installed on side mirror trim to check fitting\nSide mirror trim with new tweeter installed\nOnce you finished both side mirrors the next step is to find a place to install the passive crossover without it interfering anything. The best place I found was near the upper door frame here:\nPolk Audio crossover placed temporarily on door frame with tape\nDoor panel installed with Polk Audio crossover to check for fitment\nI put on the door panel to make sure I was able to install it later without having to bend or break something. Once I knew this location would work I secured the crossover housing with double sided velcro adhesive and cable ties. There is most likely a better way to install this crossover, but this is the best my noggin and lack of tools can come up with. Now all you need to do is extend the speaker wires so they can reach the crossover mounted location.\nThe speaker connector on the doors needs to be cut off and extended The main signal wire from the harness (that was cut off from the connector) needs to be extended to reach the crossover The tweeter wire needs to be extended This is a total of 6 wires that will need to be extended. I used the spare speaker wire that came in the Polk Audio DB 6502 package for all these extensions.\nPolk Audio crossover securely installed and connected to\nIf you secured the Polk Audio crossover using my cable tie method you will run into the issue where the crossover cover does not sit properly due to the cable tie being in the way. To resolve this I simply filled a groove on the housing where the cable tie is and was able to put on the cover on no problem.\nPolk Audio crossover with hole filed on edge\nPolk Audio crossover cover installed\nIf you are wondering what decibel I set the tweeters to the answer is 3db. 6db is what came by default and was a bit too loud for my taste. I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t know the crossover had a tweeter decibel setting until I removed the cover to do the custom mounting. The decibel selection is in the upper left corner of the housing.\nPolk Audio crossover tweeter decibel setting set to 3db\nHead Unit USB Port So the Sony XAV-AX7000 comes with two USB type a female connector cables which are used for wired Android Auto/Apple Carplay and media playback. To hide these cables and make it look official/OEM, I decided to install a 2 Port Dual USB 3.0 mount. The best place I found to install this was inside the center console box. With the shift boot out of the way from the previous step, unbolt the center console box and remove it from the car.\nSide shot of the center console box\nNext take the step drill bit and drill a hole for the USB mount. The place I opted for was near the bottom of the center console box storage compartment:\nUSB mount installed inside the center console box Now simply re-install the center console box and route up the USB wires to the head unit. The placement is a bit awkward to connect a USB cable to, but if you leave a USB cable connected to it all the time it\u0026rsquo;s not really a big deal. Plus I personally don\u0026rsquo;t use phone navigation much unless i\u0026rsquo;m going on a long road trip which means 99% of the time I will be connected to bluetooth anyway.\nSummary Hopefully this article will be useful to someone. A lot of vehicle information is shared for free online on various different sites that I just wanted to give back to the community. All the photos on this article have been resized for web optimization. If you want to see higher resolution images as well as images of the project that I didn\u0026rsquo;t upload here, a Google photos album has been created.\nLooking back on this audio upgrade, the only thing I would change is the speaker adapters for the speaker brackets. I would have rather have made them with acrylic rather than wood. Luckily I live in a dry climate, but I will still be checking on them every once in a while to see how they are holding up. I also recorded my progress towards the end of the project. Mostly just to remind myself where and how I ran the wires. Here is the link to that video: https://youtu.be/0D09l8Cgm2k. Could be useful into seeing how I ran all the wires and were I grounded stuff to.\nIf you have any questions just leave a message below (if Disqus works) and I\u0026rsquo;ll try to answer them.\n"
